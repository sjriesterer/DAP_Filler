They deserve a medal for a job well done.","You're great at figuring stuff out.","Your voice is magnificent.","The people you love are lucky to have you in their lives.","You're like a breath of fresh air.","You make my insides jump around in the best way.","You're so thoughtful.","Your creative potential seems limitless.","Your name suits you to a T.","Your quirks are so you -- and I love that.","When you say you will do something, I trust you.","Somehow you make time stop and fly at the same time.","When you make up your mind about something, nothing stands in your way.","You seem to really know who you are.","Any team would be lucky to have you on it.","In high school I bet you were voted \"most likely to keep being awesome.\"","I bet you do the crossword puzzle in ink.","Babies and small animals probably love you.","If you were a scented candle they'd call it Perfectly Imperfect (and it would smell like summer).","There's ordinary, and then there's you.","You're someone's reason to smile.","You're even better than a unicorn, because you're real.","How do you keep being so funny and making everyone laugh?","You have a good head on your shoulders.","Has anyone ever told you that you have great posture?","The way you treasure your loved ones is incredible.","You're really something special.","Thank you for being you.","It’s really all about love.","One sweater you really like is better than five sweaters you kinda sorta like and bought because they were on sale.","Don’t wait for any one human to give you all the care and love you crave. No one can be your all, but some people can be your a lot. Cherish them.","Stop trying to be fearless. If you’re trying and learning, you will feel fear. It’s OK. Feel it, and do it anyway.","Read the entire recipe before you start cooking.","Failure hurts and it sucks. But your greatest learning and triumph may often come from failure, as long as you remember that failure is not a state of being, but an occurrence on a path.","Most things are better after a good night of sleep.","Don’t save your nice dishes, nice clothes, nice shoes for a special occasion. Every day you’re alive is a special occasion, so use the good stuff!","When in doubt, go for a walk.","You can only change yourself. Not other people, not relationships, just you.

Make more art. All kinds of art, even art you don’t like. Escape into it with your whole soul.","Sweat the small stuff that makes you even the tiniest bit happier: Fill your shelves with books you love. Rush to the farmer’s market for the season’s first strawberries. Buy pens you like to write with. Move your desk to catch the morning sun. These make up the texture of your life.","Creating a process works better than setting a goal. \"Every day at 8am I will go for a walk,\" is a lot more useful than \"I’m going to walk 100 miles this month.\"","You. Are. Enough. You are lovable and amazing and deserving of true genuine happiness exactly the way you are. You don’t have to do anything more to earn it.

Mostly we’re all focused on ourselves, so stop worrying about perceptions and live your life.","You experience 100% of the emotions you give to others. If you feel angry at someone, you experience anger. If you experience kindness, you feel kind.","It’s OK to have a mess of a day. Sometimes you actually do need to eat too much, watch too much TV, and hide under the covers away from it all.","If you do something and it makes you feel spectacular, don’t ignore that feeling. It’s the universe trying to tell you: This thing you just did? Do it more often. Yes, this applies to what you do for work, too.","Be more honest. Being vulnerable doesn’t make you weak, it makes you real. Be real. It’s a gift not just to yourself, but to everyone around you.","You are not your thoughts. You are not your feelings. They are part of you, but not the entirety of you. Learn to be aware of them rather than become them.","Make things with your hands as often as you can. Cook, paint, plant, play an instrument, anything. You’ll get a break from living in your head.","When you’re having a horrid day, even the tiniest achievements feel amazing. Clean your desk, do a handstand, write things down on your to-do list, which you’ve already accomplished.","Be intentionally kind and expect nothing in return.","Give up your ideas of how something should be. Life is unfolding as it is, and you have a choice to either be awake to how it is and go from there or suffer wishing it were different.","Most things taste a lot better right out of the container: Ice cream, milk, sardines.","Find time for stillness and silence every day. Don’t be afraid of spending some time alone. Alone = ALL ONE.","The greatest moments in a friendship often come when you text a friend and say: \"Hey, I’m feeling awful and I need you.\"","One of the hardest things to do is to forgive. The hardest thing to do is to forgive yourself. Keep trying.","Travel more and often. This may be one of the only ways to buy happiness with money. Also, take time to travel on your own. You’ll discover more about yourself than the places you visit.","Break your own rules as often as possible. Try spicy food even if you’re \"not into spicy food\". Wear something bright if you usually wear black. Read things \"you’re normally not into\". Give yourself freedom to explore.","Take care of yourself. It’s not selfish, it’s your responsibility to the people you love. There’s no glory in being a martyr.","Bright red lipstick is pretty much always the answer.","The greatest gift your kids give you is the ability to experience unconditional love.","Never be too busy for a hug. Or too grumpy. Or too proud.","Just because you can’t see it right now, doesn’t mean the path is not there. Keep taking steps.","If you have to force it — an idea, a piece of writing, a job, a relationship, a shoe — it’s not meant to be. Working hard and forcing something are two different things. Learn the difference.","It’s all really about love. Not romantic love, not any specific kind of love, just LOVE. It’s within you. Find it. Nurture it. Share it. Grow it. Swim in it. It’s always the right answer, although sometimes you’ll have a hard time seeing it. Keep looking.","You’re that \"Nothing\" when people ask me what I’m thinking about.","You look great today.","You’re a smart cookie.","I bet you make babies smile.","You have impeccable manners.","I like your style.","You have the best laugh.","I appreciate you.","You are the most perfect you there is.","Our system of inside jokes is so advanced that only you and I get it.

It might be the best thing they experience all day.","If you're stuck, take a step, any step. It doesn't need to have a direction or be the most perfect optimal step in the right direction.

Allow yourself to feel all of your emotions, including the sad, difficult, painful ones, without judgment or pressure to feel or not feel a certain way. The distance between how you feel and how you decide you should feel is the valley of suffering you create. Instead, treat yourself with self-compassion, accept that what you feel is what you feel, and you'll notice the intensity of the difficult feelings ease up. From that place of acceptance you'll have a much better chance to see more clearly what you might do and practice to feel better.","Thank you for existing.","You make me see the world in a way no one else ever has.","I love the way you make me think.","I appreciate the way you challenge me.","Around you, I’m the best possible version of myself.","Your energy is infectious.","I can’t stop thinking about you.","I love you so much it hurts.","You are my world.","When we’re together, everything seems possible.","I can’t do life without you.","I don’t want to be anywhere you can’t be.","You’re my constant reminder that people can be good.","There’s a softness behind your eyes.","Your laugh is my favorite sound.","The world would be so boring without you.","Are you for real?","How did I get so lucky?","You make the little things feel big.","Loving you feels like the most natural thing.","You impress me every single day.","Your capacity for kindness is boundless.","When we’re together, the rest of the world melts away.","I wish I were half the human you are.","I didn’t know what love was until I met you.","I didn’t know how important friendship was until we met.","It would be torture to lose you.","My life before you was utter dullness.","There’s no one like you.","Hugging you is the only comfort I need.","You’re not as dumb as you let people think you are.","You’re an amazing mother.","You’re beautiful.","Your soul is gorgeous.","I love your brain.","I love how weird you are.","You’re more of a superhero than any Marvel character out there.","You inspire me.","You are so strong.","[prolonged pause] Sorry you’d think I’d never seen a woman before.","Your voice soothes me.","Your existence makes me feel better about life.","The very idea of you makes me smile inside.","I’ve never met a person as [insert hyperbolic adjective] as you are.","Mating with you would be a smart evolutionary play.","Some people are radiators—they make you feel warm when you’re around them.","I’ve never met anyone as caring as you.","No one else can make me laugh like you do.","You have such a good heart.","You have great [insert random body part].","You are truly unforgettable.","You are way too smart for me.","Wow.
